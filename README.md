# Iris Data Visualization

## Task Objective
To explore and visualize the Iris dataset, understand its features, and identify patterns and relationships using data visualizations.

## Dataset Used
- **Name:** Iris Dataset
- **Source:** Built-in dataset from Seaborn or available from UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Models Applied
- No predictive models; only data inspection and visualization techniques using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Key Results and Findings
- The Iris dataset is well balanced across three species.
- Clear patterns are visible between petal length/width and species, which can be used for classification.
- No missing data or significant outliers were found.
- Visualizations such as pair plots, histograms, and boxplots provided strong insights into feature distributions and relationships.
